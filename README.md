# README #

* This is code for my senior design project, an entrant into the 2017 IEEE Region 5 Robotics competition. (We got 3rd). This is published for use in my portfolio as well as my personal reference. If you haven't met me, it's likely not for you. But if the lack of documentation and details regarding the robot's physical construction doesn't bother you, feel free to use it. I reserve the right to a royalty on any profits (exempt contest winnings). Code may be redistributed for free with only an acknowledgement to me.
